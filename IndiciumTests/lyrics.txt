If that's the way it's gonna be.
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep.
And start burning up your tires.
And take your cold hard cash.
And this shirt right off my back.
I don't mind.
'Cause I'm gonna set this house on.
Don't have to hit below the belt.
With those leather shoes you wear so well.
No, you don't have to kiss and tell.
'Cause you're only gonna hurt yourself.
The minute that I walk in.
You're tryna hold me down.
Tryna sink your claws in.
'Til I'm face flat on the ground.
Don't know what you've been drinking.
Every time you come around.
So let me down.
If that's the way it's gonna be.
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep.
And start burning up your tires.
And take your cold hard cash.
Take this shirt right off my back.
I don't mind.
'Cause I'm gonna set this house on fire.
I sent you running for the hills.
I guess by now you know the drill.
The type that only shoots to kill.
And you only do it for the thrill.
The minute that I walk in.
You're tryna hold me down.
Tryna sink your claws in.
'Til I'm face flat on the ground.
Don't know what you've been drinking.
Every time you come around.
So let me down.
If that's the way it's gonna be.
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep.
And start burning up your tires.
And take your cold hard cash.
Take this shirt right off my back.
I don't mind.
'Cause I'm gonna set this house on fire.
House on.
Set this house on.
House on.
House on fire.
House on fire.
House on fire.
House on fire.
If that's the way it's gonna be.
Leave your shiny yellow key on the doorstep.
And start burning up your tires.
And take your cold hard cash.
Take this shirt right off my back.
I don't mind.
'Cause I'm gonna set this house on.
