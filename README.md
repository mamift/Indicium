# Indicium 

*Latin for 'token' or 'sign'.*

Indicium is a generic tokeniser library meant to make it easier to construct tokenisers (which are also known as `scanners` or `lexers`). 

It's main use is in generating code that can be used to create simple tokenisers. The tokens themselves are defined by regular expressions, and can be defined either in code or in simple XML files that store their definitions, which can then be used to generate more code.
